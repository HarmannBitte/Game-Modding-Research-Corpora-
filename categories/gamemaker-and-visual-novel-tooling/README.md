- **[DDLC Mod Template 2.0 (community, v5.1.0)](<https://github.com/Bronya-Rand/DDLCModTemplate2.0/releases/tag/5.1.0>)** — Unofficial community template for mods of the original DDLC PC game; the project explicitly says it is not affiliated with Team Salvato and is not designed for DDLC Plus. v5.1.0 (2026-10-06) provides separate Py3/Ren'Py 8 and Py2/Ren'Py 7 packages; the author marks the Py2 line final except for bug fixes. Android build support was re-added, but requires player-supplied game files and does not prove compatibility with the separately released mobile app or permit app-store distribution. The template's Android note says no official APK, so treat that package boundary as unresolved.

- **[GameMaker mod.io Extension (YoYo Games)](<https://github.com/YoYoGames/GMEXT-mod.io>)** — Official developer extension for integrating mod.io UGC services into a GameMaker project; it is not a player-side loader and does not add mod support to already-shipped games unless their developers integrated it. Latest release located is v1.0.2 (2024-12-18), tagged for GameMaker LTS 2022; the main branch is explicitly work in progress, and current LTS 2026 compatibility is unverified despite repository build-script activity in 2026.

- **[Ren'Py 8.5.3 (official SDK release)](<https://www.renpy.org/latest.html>)** — Official release page for Ren'Py 8.5.3 (released 2026-05-15; latest stable located on 2026-10-06). The SDK is an authoring toolkit for Windows, macOS, and Linux, not a universal player-side mod loader. Match the target project's Ren'Py/Python generation and exact game build.

- **[Ren'Py developer tools](<https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/developer_tools.html>)** — Official docs for Ren'Py lint, console, script reload, and inspection; some functions require developer mode/config (for example, the console and script reload). These are authoring/debug features, not a player-side loader or universal packaged-game mod API.

- **[Ren'Py Translation Documentation](<https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/translation.html>)** — Official translation authoring workflow for dialogue, interface strings, images/files, and styles when project scripts are available. Upstream says its focus is sanctioned translations using creator-supplied scripts/templates and that unsanctioned support is more limited; this is not a general player-side mod path.

- **[UndertaleModTool](<https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool>)** — Active open-source GameMaker data-file editor/decompiler for Undertale, Deltarune, and other compatible titles. Latest stable v0.9.2.0 (2026-08-23): 64-bit Windows GUI; CLI builds for Windows, Ubuntu, and macOS, including native macOS ARM64. This release adds some GameMaker 2026.1 beta file/code-generation support and Deltarune Chapter 5 fixes, not a per-title compatibility guarantee. It edits files and GML VM code; YYC code editing is unsupported, and it is not a runtime loader.
